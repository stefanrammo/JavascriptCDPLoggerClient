A simple JavaScript interface for communicating with CDP applications that include a CDPLogger component to retrieve historic data. 
For documentation on the JS logger see [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md).
For a quickstart guide on how to set-up the npm project for either Node or Web see [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)
